Container Orchestration Virtual Framework Encapsulation Front End

# Usage
A front end for a Unikernel based distributed processing engine.

Effectively a set of unikernel systems is like a set of processes each with their own network stacks. They are rather similar to statically compiled programs with additional features such as a network stack and isolated namespace.

A highly responsive interface to observe distributed running systems and current state would be most useful.
