Container Orchestration Virtual Framework Encapsulation Front End

#Usage
A front end for a Unikernel based distributed processing engine.

Effectively a set of unikernel systems is like a set of processes each with their own network stacks. They are in effect statically compiled programs with additional features.

A highly responsive interface to observe distributed running systems and current state would be most useful.

#Languages
Go, Python, C
